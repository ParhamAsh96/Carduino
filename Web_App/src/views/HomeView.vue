              The Carduino offers a comprehensive suite of smart features. It
              automatically logs historical data, capturing every temperatqure
              extreme, top-speed run and total distance covered, while a live
              trip page displays current temperature, speed and distance from
              the moment you set off. A unified control dashboard lets you
              monitor the car's surroundings, check those real-time metrics,
              sound the horn and even play music. When your route is pre-marked,
              you can engage line-follower mode and let the Carduino steer
              itself by tracing the path. A collision-avoidance system alerts
              you on the dashboard and can brake autonomously to prevent an
              impact, though you may toggle this safety net on or off. Like any
              road-ready vehicle, the Carduino activates a red brake light
              whenever you slow down and a green parking light that boosts
              visibility after dark; both lights are deemed essential and
              therefore remain automatic. Additional headlights are yours to
              switch on through the control page whenever you need extra
              illumination, and an energy-saving auto-shutdown powers the car
              down after prolonged inactivity.
