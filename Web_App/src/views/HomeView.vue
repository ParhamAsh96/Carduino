              The Carduino delivers a rich set of connected features designed
              around performance, convenience and efficiency. It automatically
              logs every temperature extreme, top-speed run and total distance
              covered, while a control page shows you current temperature, speed
              and distance from the moment you set off. A specialized music's
              page permits honking and playing built in tunes. Through the web
              app's control dashboard, using on-screen buttons or PC keyboard
              shortcuts will let you steer the car. For safety, two rear brake
              lights glow red when you brake or park, switch to white when you
              reverse, and remain off when you move forward. Finally, after
              extended inactivity the Carduino's energy saving auto-shutdown
              powers the system down to preserve battery life, so it's always
              ready when you are.
